# Face-Recognization

In this project, I implemented and perform principal component analysis (PCA) on Iris and a large dataset of celebrity face images (Eigenface algorithm).

- Visualized principal component projections and explore the meaning of the data representation.
- Used visualization to guide decisions about data dimensionality reduction.
- Implemented a face recognization using PCA.
